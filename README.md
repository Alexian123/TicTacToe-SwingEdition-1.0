# TicTacToe-SwingEdition-1.0
A fully featured TicTacToe game made with the Java Swing library, complete with a single player mode and a 2 player mode.

The single player mode has 3 difficulties you can choose from in the settings menu.
There is also an option to change the game language from English to Romanian.

Note: the game will work fine without some of the assets, however it will log the errors.
The logs and the settings preset file will be found in the '~/TicTacToe - Swing Edition - User Files' directory, which will be created after running the game for the first time.
If you feel like the game is not running properly be sure to check the logs, or run the game from a console/terminal window.

The sound FX used do not belong to me. They were uploaded to YouTube on various chanels.
The 'X' and '0' textures are made by me, with the exception of the background paper texture, which I downloaded from the internet.

Installation:
  - Windows: simply download and run the installer.
  - Linux/UNIX: either build from source or only download the 'Resources' folder and the jar file found in 'out/artifacts/*.jar'
